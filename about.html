  <h1>About Molecular Labs</h1>
  <p>MolecularLabs started out of the frustration of not being able to get great timbered and nuanced sound for a film score. Co-founder Nishant Ela Menon, a comp. Neuro post grad and a professional filmmaker spoke to his long time friend Farud cama about the problem. a few months later Nishant knocks on Farud's door with a rolled up chart and the most complicated plan which took Farud 2 full bottles of whiskey to understand. Farud wakes up the next day realising the power of Nishant's idea and starts to work on it. With the Collab labs in tow they crack their first POP!</p>
